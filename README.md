# Enron-Fraud-Detection


Enron Corporation, an energy, commodities, and services company infamously went bankrupt in December 2001 as a result of fraudulent business practices.


The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission released more 1.6 million emails sent and received by Enron executives in the years from 2000â€“2002.


We use the metadata of these mails which contains information such as number received by and sent from each individual, and financial information including salary and stock options to identify the POI (Person of Interest). The persons of interest are the individuals who were eventually tried for fraud or criminal activity in the Enron investigation.


The ultimate objective of investigating the Enron dataset is to be able to predict cases of fraud or unsafe business practices far in advance, so those responsible can be punished, and those who are innocent are not harmed.
